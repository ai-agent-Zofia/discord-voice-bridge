## Install Openclaw skills

You can install Openclaw skills in either of these ways:

1. **From ClawHub (recommended):**
   - Open ClawHub and install/import the skill there.
   - If publishing, upload the **skill folder** that contains `SKILL.md` (not the packaged `.skill` file) when using the folder uploader.

2. **From a `.skill` artifact:**
   - Download a release asset ending in `.skill`.
   - Import/install that file with your Openclaw skill import flow.
